# Cinema Booking Microservices System

A comprehensive cinema booking platform built with microservices architecture, featuring separate services for user management, movie catalog, cinema operations, booking system, payments, and promotional coupons.

## üé¨ System Overview

This project implements a complete cinema booking ecosystem using microservices architecture with GraphQL API gateway. The system provides both public access for browsing movies and cinemas, and authenticated features for booking management.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Stack

### **Microservices Architecture**
- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point using Flask with GraphQL endpoint

- **Database Per Service**: MySQL databases with service-specific schemas

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Python Flask for all services
- **API Layer**: GraphQL with Graphene library
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with dedicated schemas per service
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap 5.3
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication

### **Security Features**
- Private internal network for service communication
- No direct database access from external networks
- JWT token-based authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
